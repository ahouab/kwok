# Architecture

{{< hint "info" >}}

This document will introduce the architecture of KWOK.

{{< /hint >}}

## `kwok`

`kwok` is a resource controller, similar to `kube-controller-manager`, that is responsible for simulating the lifecycle of fake nodes, pods, and other Kubernetes API resources.

It can run in any environment, use in-cluster or kubeconfig to connect to a `kube-apiserver` of cluster, and then manage the resources of the cluster.

So far, `kwok` has implemented the following controllers:

- Node Controller - It is responsible for selecting the nodes to simulate, and then simulating the nodes' lifecycle, just by updating the node status field (which originally should be reported by kubelet).
  You can also define and customize node's lifecycle through [Stages Configuration].
- Node Lease Controller - It is responsible for reporting node heartbeats by creating and renewing the node lease objects for those managed nodes. See [Node HeartBeats] and [KEP 589] for more details.
- Pod Controller - It is responsible for pod that is on selected node, and plays the stage of pod's lifecycle.

See [Stages Configuration] for more details.

## `kwokctl`

`kwokctl` is a CLI tool designed to streamline the creation and management of clusters, with nodes simulated by `kwok`.

It creates the cluster with the `kwokctl create cluster` command.

Use the runtime to start the control plane component, and then access it from `kube-apiserver` as if it was a real cluster.

```

### Runtimes

We now provide some runtime to simulate the cluster, such as:

- `binary` - It will download required binaries of control plane components and start them directly.
- `docker` - It will use `docker` to start the control plane components.
- `podman` - It will use `podman` to start the control plane components.
- `nerdctl` - It will use `nerdctl` to start the control plane components.
- `kind` - It will use `kind` to start a cluster and deploy the `kwok` into it.

### Components

This is a list of control plane components that `kwokctl` will start:

- `etcd`
- `kube-apiserver`
- `kube-controller-manager`
- `kube-scheduler`
- `kwok-controller` (as `kwok`)
- `prometheus` (optional, for metrics)

### Tools

`kwokctl` provides some well-known tools as subcommands to access the cluster, such as:

- `kwokctl kubectl`
- `kwokctl etcdctl`
