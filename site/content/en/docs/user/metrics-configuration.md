# Metrics Configuration

{{< hint "info" >}}

This document walks you through how to configure the Metrics feature.

## What is a Metrics?

The [Metrics] is a [`kwok` Configuration][configuration] that allows users to define and simulate metrics endpoints exposed by kubelet.

The YAML below shows all the fields of a Metrics resource:

``` yaml
kind: Metrics
apiVersion: kwok.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: <string>
spec:
  path: <string>
  metrics:
  - name: <string>
    help: <string>
    kind: <string>
    dimension: <string>
    labels:
    - name: <string>
      value: <string>
    value: <string>   # for counter and gauge
    buckets:          # for histogram
    - le: <float64>
      value: <string>
      hidden: <bool>
```

There are total four metric-related endpoints in kubelet: `/metrics`, `/metrics/resource`, `/metrics/probe` and `/metrics/cadvisor`,
all of which are exposed with a Prometheus style. The Metrics resource is capable of simulating endpoints with such style.

To simulate a metric endpoint, first, you need to specify the RESTful `path` of the endpoint,
which will be installed and exposed by the metric service of `kwok` at port `10247` after applied.
The `path` must start with `/metrics`, otherwise, `kwok` will not install it.


{{< hint "info" >}}
Starting from metrics-server 0.7.0, it is allowed to specify the path to scrape metrics for a node.
Specifically, metric-server will check if a node has annotation `metrics.k8s.io/resource-metrics-path` 
and use it as the target metric scrape path. Combing with the Metric CR, the feature makes it possible to integrate
`kwok` and metrics-server easily. For a fake node, by adding that annotation and setting its value to the `path`
specified in a Metric resource, metrics-server will collect data from the endpoints exposed by `kwok` instead of
scrapping from kubelet.
{{< /hint >}}

Besides, compared to kubelet, which only exposes the metric of the node it is located on, `kwok` needs to expose the
metrics of all the fake nodes it manages. Instead of creating a separate Metric CR for each fake node, it is possible
to bind all the metrics endpoints from different nodes into a single `path`. Metric CR allows for a built-in
`{nodeName}` path parameter to be included in the `path` field. For example: `/metrics/nodes/{nodeName}/metrics/resource`.
With `{nodeName}`, a single `path` is able to differentiate the metric data from different nodes.


The `metrics` field are used to customize the return body of the installed metrics endpoint.
`metrics` is a list of specific configuration items, with each corresponding to a Prometheus style metric:
* `name` defines the metric name.
* `labels` defines the metric labels, with each item corresponding to a specific metric label.
  - `name` is a const string that provides the label name.
  - `value` is represented as a CEL expression that dynamically determines the label value.
    For example: you can use `node.metadata.name` to reference the node name as the label value.
* `help` defines the help string of a metric.
* `kind` defines the type of the metric: `counter`, `guage` or `histogram`.
* `dimension` defines where the data comes from. It could be `node`, `pod`, or `container`.
* `value` is a CEL expression that defines the metric value if `kind` is `counter` or `guage`.
  Please refer to [built-in CEL extension functions] for an exhausted list that you can use to simulate the metric value.
* `buckets` is exclusively for customizing the data of the metric of kind `histogram`.
  - `le`, which defines the histogram bucketâ€™s upper threshold, has the same meaning as the one of Prometheus histogram bucket.
    That is, each bucket contains values less than or equal to `le`.
  - `value` is a CEL expression that provides the value of the bucket.
  - `hidden` indicates whether to show the bucket in the metric.
    But the value of the bucket will be calculated and cumulated into the next bucket.

Please refer to [Metrics for kubelet's "metrics/resource" endpoint][metrics resource endpoint] for a detailed example.


## built-in CEL extension functions

As `kwok` doesn't actually run containers, to simulate the resource usage data, `kwok` provides the following CEL
extension functions you can use in a CEL expression to help calculate the simulation data flexibly and dynamically:
* `Now()`: returns the current timestamp.
* `Rand()`: returns a random `float64` value.
* `SinceSecond()` returns the seconds elapsed since a resource (pod or node) was created.
  For example: `pod.SinceSecond()`, `node.SinceSecond()`.
* `UnixSecond()` returns the Unix time of a given time of type `time.Time`.
  For example: , `UnixSecond(Now())`, `UnixSecond(node.metadata.creationTimestamp)`.
* `Quantity()` returns a float64 value of a given Quantity value. For example: `Quantity("100m")`, `Quantity("10Mi")`.
* `Usage()` returns the current instantaneous resource usage with the simulation data in [ResourceUsage (ClusterResourceUsage)].
  For example: `Usage(pod, "memory")`, `Usage(node, "memory")`, `Usage(pod, "memory", container.name)` return the
  current working set of a resource (pod, node or container) in bytes.
* `CumulativeUsage()` return the cumulative resource usage in seconds with the simulation data given in [ResourceUsage (ClusterResourceUsage)].
  For example: `CumulativeUsage(pod, "cpu")`, `CumulativeUsage(node, "cpu")`, `CumulativeUsage(pod, "cpu", container.name)`
  return a cumulative cpu time consumed by a resource (pod, node or container) in core-seconds.


`node`, `pod`, `container` are three special parameters that can be used only when `dimension` is set to the corresponding value.
You should follow the below rules to use the three parameters:
* When dimension is `node`: only `node` parameter can be used.
* When dimension is `pod`: only `node`, `pod` can be used.
* When dimension is `container`: `node`, `pod`, `container` all can be used.


The functions that have more one parameter can be called in a receiver call-style.
That is, a function call like `f(e1, e2)` can also be called in style `e1.f(e2)`. For example, you can use `pod.Usage("memory")`
as an alternative to `Usage(pod, "memory")`.


{{< hint "warning" >}}

Function `Usage()` and `CumulativeUsage()` can only be used in the Metric resource.
For other functions listed above, users are also allowed to use them in ResourceUsage and ClusterResourceUsage
to build dynamic resource usage patterns.

The reason behind is that when `kwok` evaluates functions `Usage()` or `CumulativeUsage()`,
it actually takes the simulation data given in ResourceUsage and ClusterResourceUsage to obtain metric values.
Therefore, please ensure that the associated ResourceUsage or ClusterResourceUsage with the needed resource types
(cpu or memory) are also provided when using function `Usage()` and `CumulativeUsage()`.

## Out-of-box Metric Config

`kwok` currently provides the [Metrics config][metrics resource endpoint]that is capable of
simulating kubelet's `"metrics/resource"` endpoint.

To integrate the simulated endpoint with metrics-server (version is required >= 0.7.0), please add the 
`"metrics.k8s.io/resource-metrics-path": "/metrics/nodes/<nodeName>/metrics/resource"` annotation to the fake
nodes managed by `kwok`.
