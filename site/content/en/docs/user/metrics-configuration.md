# Metrics Configuration

{{< hint "info" >}}

This document walks you through how to configure the Metrics feature.

## What is a Metrics?

The [Metrics] is a [`kwok` Configuration][configuration] that allows users to define and simulate metrics endpoints exposed by kubelet.

The YAML below shows all the fields of a Metrics resource:

``` yaml
kind: Metrics
apiVersion: kwok.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: <string>
spec:
  path: <string>
  metrics:
  - name: <string>
    help: <string>
    kind: <string>
    dimension: <string>
    labels:
    - name: <string>
      value: <string>
    value: <string>   # for counter and gauge
    buckets:          # for histogram
    - le: <float64>
      value: <string>
      hidden: <bool>
```

There are total four metric-related endpoints in kubelet: `/metrics`, `/metrics/resource`, `/metrics/probe` and `/metrics/cadvisor`,
all of which are exposed with a Prometheus style. The Metrics resource is capable of simulating endpoints with such style.

To simulate a metric endpoint, first, you need to specify the RESTful `path` of the endpoint,
which will be installed and exposed by the metric service of `kwok` at port `10247` after applied.
The `path` must start with `/metrics`, otherwise, `kwok` will not install it.


{{< hint "info" >}}
Starting from metrics-server 0.7.0, it is allowed to specify the path to scrape metrics for a node.
Specifically, metrics-server will check if a node has annotation `metrics.k8s.io/resource-metrics-path`
and use it as the target metric scrape path.
Combined with the Metric CR, the feature makes it possible to integrate `kwok` and metrics-server.
For a fake node, by adding that annotation and setting its value to the `path`
specified in a Metric resource, metrics-server will collect data from the endpoints exposed by `kwok` instead of
scrapping from kubelet.

Besides, compared to kubelet, which only exposes the metric of the node it is located on, `kwok` needs to expose the
metrics of all the fake nodes it manages. Instead of creating a separate Metric CR for each fake node, it is possible
to bind all the metrics endpoints from different nodes into a single `path`. Metric CR allows for a built-in
`{nodeName}` path parameter to be included in the `path` field. For example: `/metrics/nodes/{nodeName}/metrics/resource`.
With `{nodeName}`, a single `path` is able to differentiate the metric data from different nodes.


The `metrics` field are used to customize the return body of the installed metrics endpoint.

The descriptions of each sub-field are available at [Metric API][Metric]. 
For readers' convenience, we also mirror the documents here with some additional notes.

`metrics` is a list of specific configuration items, with each corresponding to a Prometheus style metric:
* `name` defines the metric name.
* `labels` defines the metric labels, with each item corresponding to a specific metric label.
  - `name` is a const string that provides the label name.
  - `value` is represented as a CEL expression that dynamically determines the label value.
    For example: you can use `node.metadata.name` to reference the node name as the label value.
* `help` defines the help string of a metric.
* `kind` defines the type of the metric: `counter`, `gauge`, or `histogram`.
* `dimension` defines where the data comes from. It could be `node`, `pod`, or `container`.
* `value` is a CEL expression that defines the metric value if `kind` is `counter` or `gauge`.
  Please refer to [CEL expressions in `kwok`] for more detailed instructions that might be helpful to simulate the metric value.
* `buckets` is exclusively for customizing the data of the metric of kind `histogram`.
  - `le`, which defines the histogram bucketâ€™s upper threshold, has the same meaning as the one of Prometheus histogram bucket.
    That is, each bucket contains values less than or equal to `le`.
  - `value` is a CEL expression that provides the value of the bucket.
  - `hidden` indicates whether to show the bucket in the metric.
    But the value of the bucket will be calculated and cumulated into the next bucket.

Please refer to [Metrics for kubelet's "metrics/resource" endpoint][metrics resource endpoint] for a detailed example.


## Out-of-box Metric Config

`kwok` currently provides the [Metrics config][metrics resource endpoint] that is capable of
simulating kubelet's `"metrics/resource"` endpoint.

To integrate the simulated endpoint with metrics-server (required version >= 0.7.0), add the 
`"metrics.k8s.io/resource-metrics-path": "/metrics/nodes/<nodeName>/metrics/resource"` annotation to the fake
nodes managed by `kwok`.
