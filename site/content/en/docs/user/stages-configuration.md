# Stages Configuration

{{< hint "info" >}}

This document walks you through how to configure the Stages of Lifecycle.

{{< /hint >}}

## What is a Stage?

The [Stage API] is a [`kwok` Configuration][configuration] that allows users to define and simulate different stages in the lifecycle of Kubernetes resources, such as nodes and pods.
Each Stage resource specifies a `resourceRef` field that identifies the type of resource that the stage applies to, and a `selector` field that determines when the stage should be executed.

A Stage resource has the following fields:

``` yaml
kind: Stage
apiVersion: kwok.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: <string>
spec:
  resourceRef:
    apiGroup: <string>
    kind: <string>
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      <string>: <string>
    matchAnnotations:
      <string>: <string>
    matchExpressions:
    - key: <expressions-string>
      operator: <string>
      values:
      - <string>
  weight: <int>
  delay:
    durationMilliseconds: <int>
    durationFrom:
      expressionFrom: <expressions-string>
    jitterDurationMilliseconds: <int>
    jitterDurationFrom:
      expressionFrom: <expressions-string>
  next:
    statusTemplate: <string>
    finalizers:
      add:
      - value: <string>
      remove:
      - value: <string>
      empty: <bool>
    delete: <bool>
  immediateNextStage: <bool>
```

By setting the `selector` and `next` fields in the spec section of a Stage resource,
users can specify the conditions that need to be met for the stage to be applied,
and the changes that will be made to the resource when the stage is applied.
The `next` field allows users to define the new state of the resource using the `statusTemplate` field,
modify the `finalizers` of the resource, and even `delete` the resource.

It is worth noting that there is no dedicated field for arranging the execution order if multiple stages of a resource type are provided.
The execution order of stages can be controlled by utilizing `selector.matchExpressions` and `next` field together.
Specifically, users can chain the stages by ensuring that `selector.matchExpressions` of a stage match the status content specified in the `next` field of a previous stage.
Please refer to [Default Pod Stages] for a detailed example.
If multiple stages of a resource type share the same `selector` setting, `kwok` will randomly choose a stage to apply for a specific resource. 
Users can also customize the probability of a stage being selected via the `weight` field.
This is useful when you want the resources under a certain type to enter different stages according to a certain probability distribution.
Please note that `weight` only takes effect among stages with same `resourceRef` and `selector` settings.

Additionally, the `delay` field in a Stage resource allows users to specify a delay before the stage is applied,
and introduce jitter to the delay to specify the latest delay time to make the simulation more realistic.
This can be useful for simulating real-world scenarios where events do not always happen at the same time.

By configuring the `delay`, `selector`, and `next` fields in a Stage, you can control when and how the stage is applied,
providing a flexible and scalable way to simulate real-world scenarios in your Kubernetes cluster.
This allows you to create complex and realistic simulations for testing, validation, and experimentation,
and gain insights into the behavior and performance of your applications and infrastructure.

## Examples

### Node Stages

This example shows how to configure the simplest and fastest stages of Node resource, which is also the default Node stages for `kwok`.

### Pod Stages

This example shows how to configure the simplest and fastest stages of Pod resource, which is also the default Pod stages for `kwok`.

[Default Pod Stages]

``` goat { height=510 width=550 }
      o
      |
      | Pod scheduled to Node that managed by kwok
      v

      | .metadata.deletionTimestamp be set
      v

      | Pod be deleted
      v
