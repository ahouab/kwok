# `KWOK` (`K`ubernetes `W`ith`O`ut `K`ubelet)

<img align="right" width="180px" src="/favicon.svg">

[KWOK] is pronounced as `/kwÉ”k/`.

[KWOK] is a toolkit that enables setting up a cluster of thousands of Nodes in seconds.
Under the scene, all Nodes are simulated to behave like real ones, so the overall approach employs
a pretty low resource footprint that you can easily play around on your laptop.

## What is KWOK?

KWOK stands for Kubernetes WithOut Kubelet. So far, it provides two tools:

- `kwok` is the cornerstone of this project, responsible for simulating the lifecycle of fake nodes, pods, and other Kubernetes API resources.
- `kwokctl` is a CLI tool designed to streamline the creation and management of clusters, with nodes simulated by `kwok`.

## Why KWOK?

- Lightweight: You can [simulate thousands of nodes]({{< relref "/docs/user/kwok-manage-nodes-and-pods" >}}) on your laptop without significant consumption of CPU or memory resources.
Currently, KWOK can reliably maintain 1k nodes and 100k pods.
- Fast: You can create and delete clusters and nodes almost instantly, without waiting for boot or provisioning.
Currently, KWOK can create 20 nodes or pods per second.
- Compatibility: KWOK works with any tools or clients that are compliant with Kubernetes APIs, such as kubectl, helm, kui, etc.
- Portability: KWOK has no specific hardware or software requirements. You can [run it using pre-built images]({{< relref "/docs/user/all-in-one-image" >}}), once Docker or Nerdctl is installed. Alternatively, binaries are also available for all platforms and can be easily installed.
- Flexibility: You can configure different node types, labels, taints, capacities, conditions, etc., and you can configure different pod behaviors, status, etc. to test different scenarios and edge cases.

## Getting Started

The animation below shows a test process to work with the latest version of `kwok`/`kwokctl`.

Welcome to [get started]({{< relref "/docs/user/getting-started" >}}) with the installation, basic usage, custom configuration,
and [contribution to KWOK]({{< relref "/docs/contributing/getting-started" >}}).

## `kwokctl` Runtime and OS Support

Runtime indicates which medium `kwokctl` will use to start the cluster
